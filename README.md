# üå≤ Random Forest Challenge ‚Äì Predicting Customer Income

Welcome to the **Random Forest Challenge**! This project aims to predict customer income using a Random Forest Regression model. Leveraging customer behavior, demographics, and purchasing patterns, we train a model to uncover what makes a customer *wealthy*‚Äîa crucial insight for marketing, targeting, and business decision-making.

## üöÄ Challenge Overview

**"Figuring out who the wealthy customers are is every company‚Äôs dream."**

This challenge walks through an end-to-end predictive modeling project using a marketing dataset, following these main steps:

1. **üßπ Data Preparation**  
2. **üå≤ Random Forest Modeling**  
3. **üìä Accuracy Assessment**  
4. **üõ†Ô∏è Model Tuning**  
5. **üí° Generating Insights with Explainable AI**

## üß† Problem Statement

**Goal:** Predict customer income using various behavioral and demographic indicators.

Understanding customer income helps businesses segment users effectively, personalize campaigns, and drive smarter decision-making‚Äîespecially when identifying high-value individuals, or *whales*, who are less price-sensitive.

## üìÇ Dataset & Attributes

Dataset: [`marketing_campaign.csv`](./marketing_campaign.csv)  
More info: [`Customer_s income.docx`](./Customer_s%20income.docx)

The dataset includes attributes across:
- **People** (Age, Education, Marital Status)
- **Products** (Amount spent on Wine, Meat, Gold, etc.)
- **Promotion Response** (Accepted Campaigns, Complaints)
- **Channel Usage** (Web, Catalog, Store Purchases)

---

## üìà Model & Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Model Type
- **Random Forest Regressor** ‚Äî since income is a **continuous variable**

### üîç Accuracy Assessment
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** `~6543`
- **Mean Income:** `~50,734`  
- **Std Dev of Income:** `~22,074`

This suggests the model does a reasonable job predicting income, with an average error of ~13% of the mean income.

### üåü Top 5 Features Influencing Income

    1. MntWines (~33.2%)
    
    2. MntMeatProducts (~24.2%)
    
    3. MntFruits (~8.5%)
    
    4. NumWebVisitsMonth (~7.3%)
    
    5. NumDealsPurchases (~6.6%)

        ‚úÖ Spending habits‚Äîespecially on **wines and meats**‚Äîare strong predictors of income.

        ## üîß Parameter Tuning
        
        A grid search across `n_estimators` was conducted to minimize MAE.  
        **Best Parameter:**  
        ```python
        {'n_estimators': 50}

    --> This shows that fewer trees in this case led to better generalization‚Äîpossibly due to reduced overfitting.

## üìä Key Takeaways

    * Random Forests are powerful for handling feature-rich data with minimal preprocessing.
    
    * Customer spending behaviors are powerful proxies for estimating income.
    
    * Tuning even a single parameter like n_estimators can meaningfully improve performance.
    
    * XAI techniques like feature importance provide clarity on the black-box nature of ensemble models.
